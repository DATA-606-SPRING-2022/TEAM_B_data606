# Model Deployment

The model is deployed using Streamlit. Streamlit provides UI components that may be quickly deployed on a website. Every time a user interacts with the components, Streamlit reruns the Python script. Although they have some caching and optimizations, Streamlit's straightforward design makes it simple to create interactive webpages.
